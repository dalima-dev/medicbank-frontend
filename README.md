# Frontend for consume API using mongodb

This is a simple website that consumes an API using mongodb as database.

In file script.js you may edit the baseURL variable to 'http://localhost:3000/medic', if you are running the web API in localhost on port 3000.
To run our website locally, just do the following commands:
- npm install
- npx http-server . (don't forget the dot).

Terminal will display some links where you can access the website, just choose any of them.
